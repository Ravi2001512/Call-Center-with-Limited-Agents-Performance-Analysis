# Call Center Queue System Analysis

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes the performance of a call center with a limited number of agents.  
It focuses on key operational metrics such as:
- Average wait time  
- Queue length  
- Throughput  
- Agent utilization  
- Total call volume  

The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks and recommend strategies for optimization.
